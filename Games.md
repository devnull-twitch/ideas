# Game ideas

## Multiplayer economy game

* 2D top down

* 2 Teams competition
* One input node per team creates base resource
* One central target node is finish line for all resources
* All players can build factories in the team space
* All players can connect factories by conveyor
* All factories and the resource input node have minigames to boost production/output
* (N)PC characters that can be posessed 
* UI with list of all robots
* Game starts when 2 people join and "get ready"
* Game stops on score of X

## Trivia betting chat game

* Chatbot based ( go-tmi ) 
* Twitch extension for on screen click areas
* Golang backend
* Nice backend "interface" to add questions ( create "packs" )
* HTML frontend for OBS browser view
